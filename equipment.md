# Equipment

## Mobile Mixed and Virtual Reality 
This kit provides equipment that allows multiple people to share a virtual space, in different physical locations. Rather than MR/AR/VR facilities in specific rooms, this will enable research within the urban environment. AR/VR has matured to the point where the systems are accessible to researchers, allowing e.g. genetic biologists to use stereoscopic holograms to understand DNA and protein structures. Geosciences, urban studies, archeology and architecture require large 3-dimensional models, often with the ability to overlay information onto places outside the lab and directly interact with holograms. This lab includes Meta, HTC Vive, and HoloLens headsets for both augmented and virtual reality, powered by portable computers.

## Mobile Physical Data Visualization Lab
This kit will support cutting edge data physicalization to be carried out in-situ with research partners. Data physicalization (http://dataphys.org/list) produces physical objects from datasets, and is an emerging area of human data interaction research. Hands-on interactions with physical and 3-dimensional forms allow non-specialist audiences to interrogate data. A mobile physicalization lab offers ECRs the opportunity to champion novel data engagement programmes, developing research collaborations by involving partners in hands-on, accessible data making projects. This lab will include a small desktop 3D printer, laser and die cutter to create data sculptures or objects, and a unit of sensors and motors for site-specific interactive data physicalizations.

## A Stationary Physicalization Lab
providing for fabrication equipment for larger scale, high-end data physicalization productions. In many areas such as health or medical research, the ability of researchers to draw conclusions from the physicalization hinge on the accuracy and resolution of the fabrication equipment, while the speed of the process limits the potential for participatory and collaborative work. This lab includes a range of 3D printers for a quick turn-around and simultaneous printing of larger data objects, along with multi-material 3D printers, a knitting machine and cutter plotters to support exploration of novel forms of data physicalization.

## A Surface Interaction Studio
that supports research on visualization with touch screens and related devices, including the capacity to lend devices to research partners for situated research. Touch-interaction for design is crucial in architecture, creative-industries, and design in general. This lab provides a collection of Microsoft Surface Studio 30” screens with pen and touch interaction which can be used to sketch visualizations, design infographics and communicative content (e.g. http://datacomics.net). These tablets can also support data analytics through highly interactive data visualizations (e.g., https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00781070/document).

## Augmented Projection Space
that allows large and seamless projection on walls alongside interaction through tracked devices. Such spaces can be used for collaborative discussions and decision making. This supports researchers carrying out research into large, multi-faceted datasets such as networks, geographic data, live monitoring, genetic data etc. This lab will provide a set of projectors and an object tracking system that will allow researchers to look at group multimodal interaction, developing novel ways to explore big data.

## Mobile Touch Wall
that will support direct interaction on large touch-sensitive screens (e.g, https://mt.inf.tu-dresden.de/en). The wall will be composed of between 4 and 6 high-resolution screens of around 80” inches each. Together with the respective scaffolding, we will be able to create different configurations including one single large wall for demonstrations and interactive collaborations or individual screens for individual demos. Besides collaboration, these screens can be combined with augmented reality and being used for interactively exploring very large data sets.
