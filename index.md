# The visHub?

The VisHub will be a University-wide hub for data visualization display and interaction hardware to support research across the university, especially early career researchers (ECRs). The equipment will be purchased during 2019, depending on demand and potential for the most impact. The funding is coming from a major capital grant to support the purchase of advanced tools for data visualization that has been received by the College of Science and Engineering.

On this site, we are collecting potential interest (fill form below) across the University by seeking existing projects and project ideas. If you are interested in data visualization hardware, please fill the form shown below and we will get in touch with you about future workshops, meetings, and information.

## Which equipment are we thinking of?
As data visualization is facing ever increasing challenges in terms of data size and complexity, tasks, collaboration, and communication, novel technology have become into the focus of attention. How can we exploit advanced display and interaction technology support better perception, interaction, exploration, and engagement with data? Technologies such as touch-screens, augmented reality head-sets, virtual reality, and 3D printing have reached an unprecedented quality and accessibility. Most of these hardware can be set up easily and is mobile to be transported between labs and workplaces.

The goal of this investment is to provide mobile hardware technology for data visualization across the university to support research and public outreach for researchers and beyond.

Some slides of an earlier presentation are available here: EPSRC Capital Grant VisHub. 

We are planning for five types of equipment, described in detail elsewhere.

* Mobile Mixed and Virtual Reality 
* Mobile Physical Data Visualization Lab
* A Stationary Physicalization Lab
* Surface Interaction Studio
* Augmented Projection Space
* Mobile Touch Wall

## Who are we?
The VisHub initiative is managed by a team of early-career researchers with background in data visualization, human-computer interaction, mixed reality, product design, sound design, media design, etc. We are based at the Centre for Design Informatics between the School of Informatics and the Edinburgh College of Art.

Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us (vishub@ed.ac.uk) for information and potential collaborations.

* Benjamin Bach (main contact), Lecturer in Design Informatics and Visualization, University of Edinburgh (School of Informatics).
* Dave Murray-Rust, Lecturer in Design Informatics, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh College of Art).
* Bettina Nissen, Lecturer in Interaction Design, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh College of Art).
* Larissa Pschetz, Lecturer in Design Informatics, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh College of Art).
* Jules Rawlingson, Lecturer in Digital Design, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh College of Art).
* Robin Hill, Senior Laboratory Manager, University of Edinburgh (School of Informatics).

## How can I get involved?
Once the specific hardware is in place, we will provide specific levels of access (hourly, weekly, longer), depending on demand and urgency. Projects lead by or involving ECRs will have priority, according to the mission of the fund.

We currently are preparing a set of workshops to organize interest and prepare the purchase of the equipment.
